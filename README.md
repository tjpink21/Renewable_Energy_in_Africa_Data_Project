# Renewable_Energ
This project was a novel research course project for IE 600
I was tasked with answering a novel data research question.
The world is facing an energy crisis, and one important solution to this problem is to establish renewable energy infrastructure in developing nations. I wanted to find an interesting data sceince problem relating to renewable energy in Africa.

After extensive research, I set out to find if I could predict the best countries in Africa to invest in a renewable energy project. I sourced many datasets for this project, which are sourced in my report. The code written to clean and combine these datasets is available upon request. The dataset contained in this repository is a product of that script. The dataset included is cleaned and formatted for the analysis.
